# Credit-Score-Classification
### Credit Score Preprocessing and Prediction
*The data set here is 100,000 rows large.
*In this we have done an extensive data cleaning and preprocessing of the Data and then applied various models from SciKit-Learn to predict the category of Credit score of the input data.
*We have also used hyper parameter tuning as well as Feature Importance Selection to improve the Accuracy of the model.
###This project is made for Data Analysis and Machine Learning implementation.
