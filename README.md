# Credit Score Preprocessing and Prediction

Given a personâ€™s credit-related information, built a machine learning model that classifies the persons credit score as poor, standard or good.

- The data set here is 100,000 rows large.
- In this I have done an extensive data cleaning and preprocessing of the Data and then applied various models from SciKit-Learn to predict the category of Credit score of the input data.
- I have also used hyper parameter tuning as well as Feature Importance Selection to improve the Accuracy of the model.

This project is made for Data Analysis and Machine Learning implementation.

The training dataset is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iNxtf8qyqmiXxembsyIcMW9l_oUFyvwU/view?usp=sharing or alternatively the zip file is provided to run locally.
